# GeoGebraInverter
A browser extension for inverting diagrams in GeoGebra.

## Requirements
* Chrome 111 or newer
* ManifestV3
## Usage
1. Clone the repo.
2. Go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode.
3. Click 'Load unpacked' and load the extension.

**Note:** You might need to click the button twice for it to work. You also might have to close some annnoying popups. I'm working on fixing this.
